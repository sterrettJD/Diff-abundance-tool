# Diff-abundance-tool
Simple microbiome differential abundance using STAN, based on Jamie Morton's [blog post](https://mortonjt.github.io/probable-bug-bytes/probable-bug-bytes/differential-abundance/).

Code originially uses PySTAN, but this is "translated" to R and Rstan and should hopefully serve as a minimal example for building differential abundance models in R + STAN. Hopefully planning to build this out for more multi-omics modeling and regression network analysis.
